description: design matrix for differential expression
properties:
    sample:
        type: string
        description: sample name/identifier
    condition:
        type: string
        description: > 
            sample condition to be compared during differential expression 
            analysis (e.g. treatment, disease, tissue, etc.). Optional: use 
            '*' as prefix to indicate the reference level. Otherwise, the 
            reference will be the first level in alphabetical/ascending order.
    covariates:
        type: string
        description: >
            other conditions to be taken into account during the analysis 
            (e.g. date, dose, cell line, etc.). Add as many columns as 
            covariates has your experiment. Optional: use '*' as prefix to 
            indicate the reference level. Otherwise, the reference will be the 
            first level in alphabetical/ascending order.
